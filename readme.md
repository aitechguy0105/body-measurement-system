## Project Overview
The Body Measurement System is a software application developed using OpenPose for body pose estimation and specific body measurement algorithms. The backend of the system is built using Flask and deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The system allows users to capture body measurements accurately using computer vision technology and provides valuable insights for various applications such as fitness tracking, virtual fitting rooms, and health monitoring.
